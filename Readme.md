Machine Learning Prediction API with FastAPI
This repository contains a machine learning prediction API built using FastAPI. The API allows users to send input data and receive predictions based on a trained machine learning model.

Features
FastAPI: Provides a robust and efficient backend framework for handling API requests.
Swagger UI/OpenAPI: Integrated with FastAPI for easy testing and interaction with the API.
Model Prediction: The API loads a pre-trained machine learning model (saved as a pickle file) to generate predictions based on input data.
Dockerized Deployment: Easily deployable with Docker (if applicable).

cd your-repo-name
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
Running the Application

Access the API:

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to interact with the API using Swagger UI.
In the Swagger UI, you can select the POST /predict endpoint, provide the necessary input parameters, and execute the request to observe the output.
Alternatively, you can access the OpenAPI schema at http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json.
